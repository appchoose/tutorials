# How to install tensorflow-gpu on a google cloud instance 

When I wanted to run my tensorflow models with a couple of GPUs, I thought I could just add a couple a lines to my code and make it work on the thousands of cores the graphic cards would provide me with. What I didn't realize is that there was actually another library which has been specifically developed for this purpose: `tensorflow-gpu`. And it requires much more effort than a simple `conda install tensorflow-gpu` to make things work. Here's how I proceeded in order to train my neural networks with 2 Tesla K80. 

## Install `gcc` 


The first thing you wanna get is a `C++` compiler.

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

You can verify that your installation is successful by running `gcc --version`:

```
~$ gcc --version
gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516
Copyright (C) 2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

```

## Install the kernel headers 

```
sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

## 

```
~$ sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1604-9-0-local_9.0.176-1_amd64-deb

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda
```

```
tar -xzvf cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.tgz
sudo cp cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/include
sudo cp cuda/lib64/libcudnn* /usr/local/cuda/lib64
udo chmod a+r /usr/local/cuda/include/cudnn.h /usr/local/cuda/lib64/libcudnn*
```

```
# cuda/cudnn
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:/usr/local/cuda/extras/CUPTI/lib64"
export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
```

Get the appropriate wheel [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#the_url_of_the_tensorflow_python_package) for your configuration, or the prompt will show you a red warning.

```
pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/gpu/tensorflow_gpu-1.6.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_x86_64.whl

```
