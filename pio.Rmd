In this tutorial we will see how we can customize an engine template to fit our needs. We are going to build a user recommendation system upon Apache PredictionIO's own template. 

## User recommendation system with Apache PredictionIO

We assume here that you have a working install of PredictionIO. Start the servers
by running `pio-start-all`.

```{bash}
cd
source .profile
pio-start-all
```

You can check that your system to ready to go with `pio status`.

```{bash}
cd
source .profile
pio status
```

## Download an engine

```{bash}
cd
source .profile
pio-stop-all
```
