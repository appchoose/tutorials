## To enable access to Google Cloud Storage from a VM instance

Answer taken from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27275063/gsutil-copy-returning-accessdeniedexception-403-insufficient-permission-from)

Run the following command:

```
gsutil config -b
```

This will generate a link you need to copy and paste in your browser. Copy the authentication key and paste it in the terminal.

By doing so, this will allow you to run commands such as:

```
gsutil cp 150751_2017-12-22_17#705.json gs://decembertest
```
